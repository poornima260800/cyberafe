<p>With the advent of internet, the IT industry has achieved a tremendous growth.The flip side of this industrial evolution lead to increased cyber crimes, security failures and lack of privacy. Earlier, security only involves the protection of assets typically hardware. But, now with increased usage, lot of data is exposed to the internet.The loss in this data is greater than anyother losses which can possibly occur. 
<p>This webpage will give you a beginner friendly insight on cyber security.</p></div>

<a id="1"><h3><b>1.What is cyber security?</b></h3></a>
<p>Cyber security is one of the most emerging technologies. 
The rapid increase in this is due to enormous amounts of data available on the internet.
Any malfunction in data can lead to extraordinary impacts.
 Regular check-ups is made essential to ensure that the data is free from threats.</a></p>
<a id="2"><h3><b>2.The CIA triad</b></h3></a>
<p>Cyber security broadly involves both computer and information security.It involves prevention of attacks and reduced exposure to threats by reassuring that the vulnerabilty is resolved then and there. This involves two factors like <ul><li>functionality</li><li> security</li></ul></p>
<p>Increased functionality does not make it so secure and vice versa. It should strike a balance between the two ensuring smooth user access.The industry works under a CIA triad which is a standard for maintaining the data. The CIA is nothing but <b>Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability</b></p>

<p><b>Confidentiality </b>means protecting the access from unauthorized users and letting only the valid users to access.
<b>Integrity</b> is enabling both functionality and security.<b>Availability</b> makes the data available for the endusers.</p>

<a id="3"><h3><b>3.Risk management</b></h3></a>
<p>Risk management involves 5 jargons namely,</p>
<ol>
<li>Assets</li>
<li>Vulnerability</li>
<li>Risk</li>
<li>Threat actor</li>
<li>Threat</li>
</ol>
<p>There are three kind of hackers</p>
<ul>
<li>White hat hackers are one who does legally with the consent of all the parties involved</li>
<li>Black hat hackers perform unethical practices mainly to create a situation of unrest.</li>
<li>Gray hat hackers detect and perform vulnerabilties with no intentions.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<a id="4"><h3><b>4.Who are threat actors?</b></h3></a>
In this, lets us discuss threat actor in detail.
<b>Threat actor</b> is someone who performs the threats. Threats are caused because of the exposure of vulnerability in the produced system.They may cause damage both server level and economical level. They send random crashes and worms to the well-functioning system.There are several kind of threat actors which are given in the table.
</p>
